# fmtm-splitter

This code is derived from the HOT [Field Mapping Tasking
Manager(FMTM)](https://github.com/hotosm/fmtm/wiki) and
[osm-fieldwork](https://pypi.org/project/osm-fieldwork/) projects, and
has been pulled into a separate module so it can be shared between other projects that need to do the same thing.

The splitting can be done several ways, typically squares, or the more complex way is using OpenStreetMap daata in a postgres database, and using features like highways and waterways.
